# CHF Admin

This repository is reserved for administrative materials supporting the
Cutural Heritage Framework (CHF). These may include presentations, logos,
leaftlets, and other sources of information that help others getting to
know the project. Documentation, however, is stored in the individual
component repositories with `CHF Base` serving as the starting point.
